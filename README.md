# Instrument layouts

## Introduction

This repository collects information on the geometrical layout of specific X-ray and neutron diffraction instruments and
beamlines. Such information is essential for reducing raw diffraction data.

## Contributing

The following options are available for contributing a new layout:

1. Raise an issue using the appropriate issue template
2. Create a pull request on the repository. See the `<not yet created> file` for the way the information should be presented.

Note that by contributing you are implicitly licensing your contribution as CC0 (public domain).
  
## Accuracy

While we try our best, unfortunately we can make no claims as to the accuracy of this information as it has often been provided
by third parties. Mistakes in geometry specifications will usually lead to problems in data reduction, so do check that data
are being correctly reduced the first time you make use of this information, and please advise of any errors by raising in issue.

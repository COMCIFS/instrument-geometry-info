#       ## Goniometer information

#       Answer the following questions for all axes in zero position.


principal_orientation:
    label: Principal axis orientation
    description: >
      With all angles at zero, and looking along the beam towards the detector,
      imagine an arrow drawn from the sample to the centre of the goniometer base.
      At what angle in degrees is this arrow to the horizontal plane, where 0 is
      '3 o'clock' and angles are measured counter-clockwise, so 90 is 12 o'clock
      and 270 is 6 o'clock.

goniometer_axes:
    label: Goniometer axes
    description: >
      For each axis attached to the goniometer, give the axis name (as used in
      data files if known) and sense of rotation (a=anticlockwise, c=clockwise)
      when looking from the crystal in the direction of the goniometer. Separate
      each value by a comma, for example 'Chi, c, Omega, a'. List the axes in
      order of stacking from closest to the crystal to furthest (phi would
      typically be first if present, omega is usually last).

rotation_axis:
    label: Rotation axis name
    description: "Of the axes listed in the goniometer axes previously question,
    which one is the rotation axis used for data collection?"

goniometer_rot_direction:
    label: Goniometer rotation direction
    description: >
      Please enter the rotation direction of the goniometer.
    options:
    - clockwise (c)
    - anticlockwise (a)

kappa_axis:
    label: kappa
    description: >
      If your goniometer has a kappa axis, please give its name and its;
      angle here, for example "kappa 50". When looking from above, with the
      beam going from left to right and all axes at their zero positions, the
      kappa base is assumed to be at the left. If this is not the case,
      please append the base location as a counterclockwise rotation from this
      position when looking from above. For example, if the kappa base is
      located on the detector side, type "kappa 50 180". The name of the kappa
      axis must be included in the goniometer axes.

#   attributes:

#     description: >
#       If your goniometer has a kappa axis, please give its name and kappa angle here, for example "kappa 50"

chi_axis:
    label: chi
    description: >
      If your goniometer has a chi axis, please give its name here, followed
      by an omega angle at which the chi rotation axis is parallel to the
      beam. The sense of rotation provided for chi in the "Goniometer axes"
      question above is the sense of rotation when the omega axis has been
      rotated by this angle and the chi axis is viewed from the beam source.
      For example, if omega is rotated by 90 to bring the chi axis parallel
      to the beam and moving to positive chi rotates the crystal
      anticlockwise when viewed from the source, 'chi, a' should be given for
      "Goniometer axes" and `chi 90` should be provided here. 'chi, c' with
      'chi -90' would also describe the same situation. The name of the chi
      axis must be included in the goniometer axes.

#       Answer the following questions assuming all detector positioning axes are at their home positions. If there is more
#       than one detector, or detectors
#       are non-rectangular, please describe in the comments below.

image_orientation:

      The first pixel of the raw image is located at what position on the detector
      when viewing the detector from the crystal position?
    options:
      - top left
      - top right
      - bottom left
      - bottom right
      - other
      #-(please describe in comments)

fast_direction:
    label: Fast direction
    description: >
      The second pixel of the raw image is located in what direction relative
      to the first pixel?
    options:
      - horizontal
      - vertical

pixel_size:
    label: Pixel size
    description: >
        The size of pixels in mm in order horizontal, vertical (eg '0.12, 0.15').
        If identical sizes, a single number is sufficient. Pixels are assumed to
        have no space between them, if this is not the case please write in the
        comments section below.

pixel_number:
    label: Number of pixels
    description: >
        The number of pixels in the fast and slow directions (eg '195, 487').
        This can usually be found by opening an output frame in a text editor
        and examining the header. If unknown, please provide a DOI below where
        at least one output frame from this detector is available.

two_theta_axis:
    label: Two theta axis
    description: >
      When looking from above, what is the sense of rotation of the two theta axis?
    options:
      - clockwise (c)
      - anticlockwise (a)


detector_axes:
    label: Detector Axes Names
    description: >
      Please give the names of the detector axes e.g. detx, dety.

detector_repositioning:
    label: Detector axes
    description: >
      If the detector is repositioned during data collection (excluding distance
      from the sample), please name the repositioning axes as they appear in
      data files, classify the axes as rotation or translation, and explain
      their relationship to one another, including direction of
      rotation/translation.

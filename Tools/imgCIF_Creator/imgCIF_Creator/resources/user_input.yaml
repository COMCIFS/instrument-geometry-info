      With all angles at zero, and looking along the beam towards the detector,
      imagine an arrow drawn from the sample to the centre of the goniometer base.
      At what angle in degrees is this arrow to the horizontal plane, where 0 is
      '3 o'clock' and angles are measured counter-clockwise, so 90 is 12 o'clock
      and 270 is 6 o'clock.

      each value by a comma, for example 'Chi, c, Omega, a'. List the axes in
      order of stacking from closest to the crystal to furthest (phi would
      typically be first if present, omega is usually last).

      For each rotation axis attached to the detector, give the axis name (as used

      when looking from above. Separate each value by a comma, for example:
      'detector_2theta, c'. List the axes in order of stacking from closest to
      the detector to furthest from the detector. You need to use the axis names
      which were already found in the file.

goniometer_rot_direction:
    label: Goniometer rotation direction
    required: true
    description: >
      Please enter the rotation direction of the goniometer.
    options:
    - clockwise
    - anticlockwise
    abbreviate: true

kappa_axis:
    label: kappa
    required: false
    description: >
      Your goniometer seems to have a kappa axis, please provide its name followed
      by its angle (for example "kappa, 50"). Consider the angle when looking from
      above, with the beam going from left to right and all axes at their zero positions.
      The kappa base is assumed to be at the left. If this is not the case,
      please append the base location as a counterclockwise rotation from this
      position when looking from above. For example, if the kappa base is
      located on the detector side, type "kappa, 50, 180". The name of the kappa
      axis must be included in the goniometer axes and only 0 or 180 is allowed
      for the second angle. If you don't provide a kappa axis although there is
      one, the description of the axes might be incorrect.

chi_axis:
    label: chi
    required: false
    description: >
      Your goniometer seems to have a chi axis, please provide its name followed
      by an omega angle at which the chi rotation axis is parallel to the
      beam. The sense of rotation provided for the chi goniometer axis
      is the sense of rotation when the omega axis has been
      rotated by this angle and the chi axis is viewed from the beam source.
      For example, if omega is rotated by 90 to bring the chi axis parallel
      to the beam and moving to positive chi rotates the crystal
      anticlockwise when viewed from the source, 'chi, a' should be given for
      the goniometer axis and `chi, 90` should be provided here. 'chi, c' with
      'chi, -90' would also describe the same situation. The name of the chi
      axis must be included in the goniometer axes. If you don't provide a chi
      axis although there is one, the description of the axes might be incorrect.
